# This file makes the auth directory a Python package
# When Python sees an __init__.py file in a directory, it treats that directory as a package
# This allows us to import modules from this directory using: from app.auth import something

# For now, this file is empty, but it's required for Python to recognize this as a package
# Later, we might add initialization code here if needed
